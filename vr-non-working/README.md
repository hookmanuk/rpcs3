# VR profiles and patches that are not shipped

Work in progress for games that are not yet playable in VR (see `vr-games.md`). They live outside `bin/`,
so release packages do not include them.

To try one, copy its profile to `bin/vr_profiles/` and its patch file (if any) to `bin/patches/`.
Frame-rate patches here are not marked "Enabled By Default"; enable them in `Manage > Game Patches`.

| Game | ID | Profile | Patch |
|---|---|---|---|
| God of War III | BCUS98111 | `vr_profiles/BCUS98111.json` | |
| inFamous | BCUS98119 | `vr_profiles/BCUS98119.json` | |
| inFamous 2 | BCUS98125 | `vr_profiles/BCUS98125.json` | |
| Metal Gear Solid 4 | BLUS30109 | `vr_profiles/BLUS30109.json` | `patches/BLUS30109_patch.yml` |
| Blur | BLUS30295 | `vr_profiles/BLUS30295.json` | `patches/BLUS30295_patch.yml` |
| Split/Second | BLUS30300 | `vr_profiles/BLUS30300.json` | `patches/BLUS30300_patch.yml` |
| Need for Speed Most Wanted | BLUS31010 | `vr_profiles/BLUS31010.json` | `patches/BLUS31010_patch.yml` |

Notes and evidence for each game are in the separate plans repository (`plans/profiles/<ID>-notes.md`).
